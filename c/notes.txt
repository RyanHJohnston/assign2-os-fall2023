You finished the first part (one thread).
The first thread is printing returning a sorted array and average of sorted array.
This is good.
Problem is, it's an absolute mess, memory wise.
Before writing more code, you need to properly free the memory from the heap.

Focus on the sort_thread_avg function, that's where the heap mess is.
You should be able to work on two threads afterwards.
